      <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
      <p><strong>Student ID: </strong>s3904716
        <br><strong>Email: </strong>s390416@student.rmit.edu.au
      </p>
      <p>I was born in Australia and have heritage ties to Greece and Lebanon. I have zero IT knowledge other than daily
        use.
        I’m a father of three beautiful children, currently run three businesses, and have a lengthy working career and
        life
        experience. Most of my education has been in business or real estate related. Hobbies, I work out and have
        trained
        in Jiu-Jitsu for six years. I first became interested in IT very early in primary school, when our IT teacher
        stimulated my interest with his passion for computer projects. Our first project was a traffic light system
        automatically turning on and off traffic lights in a certain order. His enthusiasm for IT was inspiring and
        stirred my own passion; I love anything electronic and techy. Since then, I have had a strong interest in any
        tech, whether in business or personal life.</p>

      <h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
      <h3>Peter’s ideal job Business Analyst, IT.</h3>
      <p>Peter’s role is as a creative and critical thinker. Peter needs to have strong communication and understanding
        of business requirements,
        attention to detail, and analytical thinking. Research and assessing current processes, technologies, and
        systems will give Peter a thorough
        understanding of problems and challenges to overcome. Peter will create data models, process diagrams, and
        wireframes. Peter will also need to
        manage relations while working closely with business decision-makers and development and testing teams to offer
        guidance and advice on the best
        scenario solutions to fit the business needs. Peter will need the tech lingo and knowledge to liaise with
        developers and systems architects to
        ensure the system is correctly implemented. He will monitor solutions and continuous improvement. Peter will
        also need to train the client's
        staff, producing manuals and documents of functionality. Generally, a Bachelor's degree in business
        administration, information systems, or a
        related field is ideal, and Knowledge of the International Institute of Business Analysis would be a plus.</p>
