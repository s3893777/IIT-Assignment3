    <p>Most of the testing for this project was to be done with the proto.io wireframes. As it would allow a space to review and test out design for the app relatively quickly. As time was a factor in this project, testing was more limited than we would have liked, but some good testing and feedback occurred between The UI designer Blade Sabre and fellow team member Peter Kassis that improve the project for the better. </p>
    <p>Early on in the development of Bake Botâ€™s UI in proto.io The UI designer of the team, Blade Sabre, kept in contact with Peter Kassis; Peter had access to the early wireframes (as did all other team members), but he gave needed constructive feedback in the crucial early stages. Like that the Bake Bot logo should bring a user back to the main menu when tapped, as this was the norm for apps. He also suggested adding small features to be shown, like an app review tab, FAQ, share function, social media integration, and terms and conditions, as these are must-haves for an app. Peter also gave some feedback on state 3 of the recipe search wireframe. On is a horizontal scrollable container of carousel. Originally there were no indicators that the section of the page was scrollable so, users could potentially not know that they could scroll the screen. After this feedback, the UI designer, Blade, added arrows to show that it was scrollable. </p>
