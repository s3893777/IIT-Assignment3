            <h2>A Teams Risks / Software Difficulties </h2>
            <p>MIT App Inventor and Proto.io are relatively new tools to us so there weren't so many risks when using them. For example, when using Proto.io we thought that we could use some of the many features too add to the app that make the app more functional, an example is the search bar where you should be able to tap on it and type up whatever you were looking up for, but we couldn't really use it because it is only there for design, it is having no technicality to it. Another issue that came up was using GitHub, when multiple people would update the repository, it wouldn't recognize the new updates (not updating at all), either we were using GitHub wrong or having too many people updating the repo at once was the cause of that issue. Some minor issues with hardware when either having a group meeting or practicing presentations would be computer microphones and cameras would go off and on at times either due to pc or the internet.</p>

          <h2>Users</h2>
          <p>Our current app is intended currently for only use for the android but in the future, we hope to expand and allow users from iOS to also use the app, but in doing so will lead to some difficulties such as if Apple will have any compatibility with the software, we are currently using. Also, with the introduction of putting our app on iOS will have to adapt and change some things to fit the apple requirements if needed.  Users also have the option to pay for the app to obtain premium features, but some users may be wary of the app being a scam, to assure the users that we have installed a feature to be paid through a financial service such as Stripe if the users don't want to pay by card directly. </p>
