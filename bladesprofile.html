      <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
      <p><strong>Student ID: </strong>s3904117
        <br><strong>Email: </strong>s3904117@student.rmit.edu.au
      </p>
      <p>Born in Queensland, Australia, I am Irish-Scottish on my father’s side and Japanese on my mother's. I am
        interested in world history and events and like to study different cultures. I also have two pet cats, Anchovy
        and Ravioli.</p>

      <p>I have always had a passive interest in IT from a young age, as I was surrounded by it for as long as I can
        remember. My
        mother and father were very early adopters of computers in the ‘80s, and even now, I can still remember, as a
        child, my
        mother using a computer and showing me the amazing things it could do. I have always loved computers and
        technology, and
        when I was a teenager, I came across a video about programming on YouTube. In the video, the programmer gave a
        quick
        backstory on himself and how he got into IT. I immediately related to his story, and it stimulated my interest.
        I then
        began watching video after video on programming. Finding the magic and wonder for something new, and since then,
        I knew
        my future would be in IT. My IT experience is limited to self-learning videos, mostly from Youtube, with no
        official IT
        experience or studies as such.</p>

      <h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
      <h3> Software Tester</h3>
      <p>Blade's ideal job is structured and formulaic as a Software Tester. Critical thinking and problem-solving are
        key. Blade's
        role will require thorough testing of every aspect of the software, quality control, and bug testing. Blade
        would assess the
        software, gather data, set up tests, troubleshoot, and report on the errors and possible solutions he finds. In
        some scenarios,
        he may assist in repairing the issues, so software development skills are required. Ideally, a computer science
        degree would
        assist in this position. Blade would program code within established testing protocols, guidelines, and quality
        standards to
        ensure systems perform to specification. He would also perform organisational systems architecture reviews and
        assessments,
        recommending current and future strategies and directions for hardware and software. Creating and reviewing
        technical
        documentation, such as procedural, instructional and operational manuals or guides, technical reports and
        specifications,
        and maintenance inventory systems would also be part of Blade's ideal job.</p>
