            <p>I was born in Australia and have lived here my whole life. I just turned twenty-nine;
              I enjoy keeping in shape with skiing, swimming, and dancing. I don't carry any IT experience
              other than my day to day use. However, I have always felt intrigued by IT for as long as I
              can remember. Whether it was through video games consoles or even general home appliances,
              I've been fascinated by what makes them operate and how they came to be.</p>

            <h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
			<h3>  Software Development </h3>
            <p>Josh’s ideal job is a creative role in Software Development. Josh will need to analyse clients needs, identifying the core
              functionality security and performance needs and then design test and develop efficient software to meet these needs.
              Communication is a great attribute to have in order to speed up the process and eliminate errors. Josh would analyse
              the current software report on every aspect that needs improvement, suggesting and implementing improvements and upgrades.
              In a new design case scenario, Josh will analyse the client’s needs and provide a report for the client to approve the design
              and functionality. Design is a key factor for Josh, as he will need to be able to design all items of the software and align
              them accordingly. Josh will also maintain the software, ensuring reliability, security, and manage any updates. Josh will need
              to run the show, he will be in charge of the entire development process of a program. In some scenarios, he may have programmers
              that write the code and in others, he may need the skills to write the code himself. Josh will also process quality control ensuring
              the end program is, as reported to the client, ensuring nothing was missed along the way. Software developers usually have a
              bachelor’s degree, typically in computer science, software engineering, or a related field.</p>
