    <h1>Scope and Limits</h1>
    <div class="main-content-section">
    <p>The scope of Bake Bot is to create a measurement converting application. Converting entire recipes based on serving size or size of measuring container (Goal 1). To monetarise the application have decided to create online baking courses and can purchase baking measuring equipment directly from the website (Goal 2 and 3).</p>
    <p>We would need to produce and create a minimum of two baking videos that will be free for the users to view. Creation and production of at least 2 paid baking courses to help in the monetarisation of the application. The most difficult will be finding chefs or cooks who have already have an established following. This will bring in users and hopefully convert them from free-users to paid-users.</p>
    <p>Achieving the third goal may take more time. The limit is finding supplier have would make our baking product to be purchased on the application. Shipping logistics of our baking products need to be researched.</p>
