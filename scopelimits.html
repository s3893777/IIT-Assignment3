    <h1>Scope and Limits</h1>
    <div class="main-content-section">
    <p>The scope of Bake Bot is to create a measurement converting application. Converting entire recipes based on serving size or size of measuring container
      (Goal 1). Other stretch goals are to have a prototype app of Bake Bot and to monetarise the application have decided to create online baking courses and
      can purchase baking measuring equipment directly from the website (Goal 2 and 3).
     </p>
     <p>One of the reasons we choose to use proto.io initially was to troubleshoot the UI of the Bake Bot app and to get a feel for the layout and flow of it.
       Once we ironed out the UI and had a clear vision of the app, we would then start adding code and forming the foundation of the Bake Bot app with MIT App
       Inventor. However, time was not in our favour, as we started late into the project, it became clear that making the whole Bake Bot app with MIT App Inventor
       was out of the team’s scope, and the plan would have to be narrowed to be more realistic. We then choose to have a proof-of-concept instead, adding on to
       what we already had rather than wasting time on something that wouldn’t be viable. We knew that if we wanted a complete project, some things would need to
       be dropped in one way or another. The aim of the project was to have at least Bake Bot’s main feature, the dynamic recipe, completed and shown. Other features
       like the store, journal, and baking course would remain mostly as visual elements as the wireframes of proto.io were limited in what they could do for the project.
