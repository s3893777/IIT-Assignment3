      <h2>1. Graphic Designer (Teamwork Experience + Innovative Thinking + Business Capability) </h2>

      <p>A graphic designer is to create new or improve on our visual concept of the app, by hand or through software. As well as communicate ideas that inspire, inform, and captivate consumers. Their job will also be to create advertisements, brochures, magazines, and reports. They would also add new ideas to the Bake Bot if any were provided. As our design of the app looks simple. Having a pro design or redesign for us may benefit the users' experiences when using Bake Bot. It may even attract more users to use the app.   </p>
      
       
      <h2>2. Mobile Application Developer / Mobile developers (Leadership + Coding Technical Expertise) </h2>
      <p>
      Mobile application developers are a type of software developers that specialize in coding for mobile applications. With mobile developers, they can improve on the system/coding of our current app. Their main job is to update and fix BB where an issue comes up. The MAD should have technical expertise when it comes to coding on mobile apps. Their role will be somewhat like a leader as they create/update the current system and get others to work as a group. 
    </p>
       
      
      <h2>3. Web Designer (Teamwork Experience + Innovative Thinking + Business Capability) </h2>
      <p>
      Web Designers are responsible for creating the design and layout of websites and web pages. The reason for a Web designer is so they can build a professional app landing page/website, which will help with app marketing before and after the app is added to the store. Having a website can make people discover/learn about the app outside the app store. The web designer will work with the graphic designer to promote the app more to expand. 
    </p>
       
      
      <h2>4. Tech Support (Teamwork Experience + Management techniques) </h2>
      <p>
      Technical support workers are to manage, maintain and support users. The main reason for tech support would be because if Bake Bot does do well, some users will have some issues with the app, and having a support department will help the users have a better experience with the app. Support requests and feedback from the users can help improve the Bake Bot. Tech support can also provide support not only to users of Bake Bot but also the people who work on Bake Bot by providing tools, programs, etc.
