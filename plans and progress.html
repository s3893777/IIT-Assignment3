<h1>What is Bake Bot</h1>
<div class="main-content-section">

<p>Bake Bot's main feature, the <i>Dynamic Recipe</i>, will allow users to truly custom and simplify their baking
        recipes to what they want. With it, a baker would be able to customise the quantity of a given recipe to what
        they need. Say you want to make three cakes instead of just one. Bake Bot will do all the math for you so you
        can focus on baking rather than math.</p>
      <p>The <i>Dynamic Recipe</i> also shows the recipe's ingredients in all measurement types so a baker can pick the
        one to their liking. Never again will you have to quickly lookup how many grams there are in a tbsps or
        millilitres in a cup. It will all be right here in the <i>Dynamic Recipe</i>. And if applicable, with the simple
        press of a button you can convert recipes into vegan alternatives or low-fat options. Scouring the internet for
        vegan cake recipes will be a thing of the past. With Bake Bot's <i>Dynamic Recipe</i>, all the information
        you'll ever need is in your hand whenever you need it.</p>
      <p>Bake Bot will have a step-by-step <i>Baking Guide</i> from start to finish. It will give a baker the exact time
        needed to bake a given dish using a countdown alarm, so you never burn your bread. It will also show the precise
        temperature needed for either fan-forced or conventional ovens. And when a baker wants that tasty crust or is
        baking a multi-staged recipe, Bake Bot will show when to change temperatures at right time, every time. And if
        it's your first time baking a new recipe? No problem. Bake Bot will give you handy tips and tricks so your first
        time making a souffle isn't a learning experience but a delicious one.</p>
      <p>Ever wanted to bake a specific recipe but forgot its name and can't for the life of you find it anywhere? Or
        maybe you want to try something new that you have never had before? With Bake Bot's intuitive <i>Recipe
          Search</i>, you can. Just enter in some key details like if the recipe is it chocolaty, fruity, or savoury? Or
        maybe what it feels like, is it fluffy, crunchy, or spongy. You can even search for recipes by nationality, like
        Danish for their pastries, French for their rich complex desserts, or Britain for those simple tea cakes. And if
        you want to try new things, you can randomly search for recipes to find those surprise favourites. With Bake
        Bot's <i>Recipe Search</i>, you'll find what you want in a flash. </p>
      <p>Bake Bot doesn't just help you bake, it teachers you too. Bake Bot's <i>Baking Beginner's Guide</i> provides
        users with a structured ten recipe short course to teach the fundamentals of baking for beginners. From simple
        stuff like baking blueberry muffins and pancakes, to the baking essentials like how to make your own self-rising
        flour or dough. Informative notes in each recipe will help you every step of the way making sure you're learning
        and on track. Everyone from kids to adults trying out baking for the first time can benefit from this. Make it
        an event and learn baking as a family with Bake Bot.</p>
      <p>Bake Bot will have a <i>Baking Journal</i> where you can save and keep your favourite custom recipes so that
        they're never lost. The <i>Baking Journal</i> also means you don't have to go through the hassle of picking a
        specific quantity every time you start the same recipe again. The <i>Baking Journal</i> can also be used to see
        your history of bakes, showing every recipe you baked and how quickly you did them, so you can see how much you
        have improved as a baker from start to finish. With Bake Bot, an entire baking book and more is at your
        fingertips. Our target audience are home bakers, our tool is designed to reduce stress and basically hold your hand through the customisation of any baking recipe making the scalability of recipes a no brainer. 
 </p>


<h1>How It works.</h1>
<p>Bake Bot is a web and mobile based application, that users can access from any online device, there is no subscription needed. </p>
<p> Bake Bot is a free to use tool to help users bake, by utilising our pre determined algorithms to assist their baking. Bake Bot has a serious of pre-determined algorithms and conversions that users can access in a user-friendly manner.  </p>
<h2> End User </h2>
<p>From an end user prospective you will proceed to www.bakebot.com.au (or similar depending on availability.) or install the Bake Bot Mobile App from the android store or apple store.
</p> <p>  Once you are on the website or in the mobile app. you will be given a four options.
</p>

<li> Recipe Search
</li> <li> Baking Journal
</li> <li> Baking Course
</li> <li> Shop
</li> <li> App Reviews
</li> <li> F.A.Q.
</li> <li> How to
</li> <li> Terms and condition,
</li> <li> Social media integrations
</li> <li> Share recipe 
</li> <li> Contact Us
</li>

<H2> Recipe Search </h2>
<p> Recipe search which is our dynamic recipe. This page will have two search functions, where the user can type and find what they are looking to bake, either by name or descriptions. If the end user clicks name they will be able to search by recipe name, such as muffins. </p>
<p> If the user searches by discription the user can search via </p>
<li> Type - Pastry, bread, cake, pie, muffins, bars, buns, rolls, biscuits, cookies, deserts, donuts & pizza. </li>
<li> Taste - Chocolate, vanilla, spicy, citrus, fruity, meaty, fresh, crumbly,saucy,tart & cheesy.  </li>
<li>Texture - Hard, soft, crumbly, rough, airy, crunchy, moist, thick, firm, chewy & creamy.   </li>
<li>Nationality - This option will list the regions around the world so a user can select a recipe based on what region they would like to bake from. </li>
<li> Flavour - Sweet or savory</li>
<p> Once the recipe is selected the user will be able to use this recipe as a dynamic recipe, meaning you can easily adjust the quantities according to the amount of people your baking for by use of sliding scales and drop downs or change the measurement into a preferred style.  </p> 
<p> In this scenario you are able to adjust measurements according to your proffered measurement style or baking volume count.  An example would be converting cups to grams. The ingredient conversion will be able to slide the cup measurement up or down and instantly see the grams according to where the slider is placed.  In this case ' Cup is 40 Grams, giving the user a quick calculation on the spot. You are able to convert from many different forms of measurements and weights, opening the door to international baking recipes. </p>
</p><p>
The end user can also adjust the recipe depending on amount of people they wish to cook for. <br>
 In the case they are happy with the measuring references and they want to know how many ingredients to use according to their desired output volume, not the just the output volume the recipe mentioned. <br>
 They are able to utilise the sliding scale to adjust the ingredients according to their output volume required. An example, the recipe mentioned making 6 cupcakes, but you have 8 people attending, you will be able to input your 8 people and/or ideal baking quantity and the dynamic recipe will adjust the ingredients to allow the correct measurements for 8 people. 
</p>
<p>The users will have the opportunity to save their favourite measuring style, defaulting their settings to show their favourite style of measurements, e.g, grams instead of ounces. Along with favourite volume of people, in the case you often bake for the same group this will speed the process of our system. 
.</p> 
<p> Once in any of the mentioned recipe sections there will also be a timer, this is a simple stop watch style alarm that the user can change accordingly. It will link with the recipe, according to the cooking instructions. <br>
 An example is the first ingredient needs to bake for 4 mins and the second 6 mins, the timer will auto sit on the next in line time needed. In this case the timer would sit on 4mins waiting for user to be ready. Once that is completed it will change to 6 mins and so on. 
 </P>
 
<h2>Baking Journal </h2>
<p> Baking journal stores your favourite recipes, custom recipes and shows you your baking history. This is your profile where you can access your saved recipes and stored information. </P> 
</P>
<p> The user will have an option listed here called custom recipe, this page will allow you to enter your measurements from an alternative source. Once you enter your measurements you will be able to quickly convert the measurement to the measurement of preference. In the case the measurements are not what your used to. An example is foreign recipes in alternative measurements then what you may find locally. </p>

<h2> Baking Course</h2>
<p> End users will use this section in the scenario of wanting to learn to bake, here there will be a list of videos with step by step guides and walk through. There will also be text pages with pictures showing walk through, in the case the user prefers to learn via text. 
Links will be from you-tube, vimeo and other external sources. </p>

<h2> Shop</h2>
<p> The shop will be used partly for users to access third party baking goods. In the scenario they want to purchase baking goods, we will have a list of our preferred/recommended items. 
We do not sell the items, we receive a click purchase commission from suppliers, tracked by use of google analytics. </P>

<H2> App Review </h2>
<p> The user will have the option to review our services, either via google, or via in app store. There will be two links the user will have the option to click. <br>
Once clicked the user will be able to rate our services via a star rating and a comment. Reviews build a strong business so its a crucial component. <br>
Once our users have used our app through one recipe they will also be prompted via pop up requesting a review.  <br>
<br>
Links as follow. <br>

<Li>Apple app store if they are apple, or Google play for android. </li>
<li> Google business page </li>
</p>



<H2> F.A.Q.</H2>
<p>Here a user will access the top 10 most frequent asked questions. This can help a user understand the app/site better without the need to chat to us.</P>
<br>

<H2> How to</H2>
<p> This page will have tutorials on how to use each feature. There will be a list of topics and links to videos on vimeo. 
</P>
<br>

<H2> Terms and condition,.</H2>
<p> Once this button is clicked the user will be able to read and approve our terms and conditions. These are the same terms and conditions that will need to be approved on install of the mobile app.
</p> 
<br>
<H2> Social media integrations</H2>
<p> Our social media pages will be listed, allowing the user quick access to our SM to follow and or comment, the more traffic we get on our social media the better for business. 
</p>
<H2> Share recipe</H2>
<p> The user will have an option to share the recipe, this is beneficial to us exposing our business to future clients. It will be a quick and easy option to share the recipe via all the major social media platforms, link email or sms. 
</p>
<br>
<br>



<h1> Back End </h1>

<p>Behind the scenes there will be standard algorithms that adjust depending on what quantities the user inserts. 
</P> <p>For the ingredients there will be pre-determined conversion algorithms such as
(128grams = 1 cup.)  (4.2 cups = 1 ltr.) (1 ltr = .26 gallon.)  (0075Gallon = 1 ounce). These will be the basis of what everything in between will be calculated. 
</P>
<p> Research needs to be had here, although i believe we can use an API or third party applications for shop layout, timer/stop watch, measurement conversions, reviews, contact us, forms  & CRM. </p>
<p> We will also use cloud servers for data management and storage. AWS is the service of choice. 
Items listed will be (Metric, US, Imperial) as follows
Cups, DL, OZ, Gal, KG, Ml, Pt, Qt, Lb, Tablespoon, Teaspoon & Celsius/Fahrenheit, 
.</p>
<p>In relation to the per person measurements Bake Bot will calculate the mentioned recipe, divide the ingredients by amount of people in that same recipe and determine the per person ingredient ratio. Once that is determined the user will select the correct amount of people they want, and Bake Bot will multiply the per person ingredient ration to the desired person count.
</p>



 <h1>Why Blake Bot?</h1>
<p>A few years ago, I decided to learn how to cook. I wanted to learn every area of cooking, so when it came time to learn baking, I was quite intimidated. It looked hard. It looked complicated. And it was. Measurements were all over the place, with tablespoons and teaspoons and cups and grams. You had to do math for some reason. And the recipes were hard too. One mistake could ruin everything. </p>
<p> It was uniquely difficult from any other type of cooking I had done up to this point. And the worst part it was all of it was unnecessary. You do not have to do math while cooking. You do not have to constantly look up how many tablespoons are in a cup. We have apps for that, right? Except we don't, all the cooking apps were for making grocery lists or for diet fads.
</p>
<p>After doing some research i found my issue was not just mine, many home bakers had this same issue, many people love to cook but find baking to be a little bit overwhelming or delicate, so they tend to stay away from it. <br>
This is when the idea came to me, if no one else was going to do it then I would have to do it myself. And make baking hassle-free forever.
</p>


 <h1>Story & Progress.</h1>
 
<p> Our progress on Bake Bot. </p>
<p>In the early progress of the Bake Bot we were first trying to establish connections, build report and to understand each other, in order to know who we are working with and work out how we would get along.
After we got to know each other a little better, it was time to understand everyones project ideas. </p> 
</p>
<p> We all allocated time and effort into building our own project idea and personal profiles.<br>
 We laid out information on ourselves, our own interpretation and also provided three personality tests. These helped us understand ourselves and each other.<br> 
 We then when into detail about what project we would like to develop. We listed items such as.
 <li>Overview of the project</Li>
  <li>The demand </Li>
   <li>Motivation</Li>
    <li>Description</Li>
	 <li>Tools</Li> 
	  <li>Hurdles</Li>
	   <li>Competition</Li>
	    <li>Hurdles</Li>
		 <li>Outcome</Li>
		  
		  <p> As a group we all took time to read each others projects and gain a strong understanding.</p>
		  
<p> We started with a group discussion about all our project ideas, how they worked and who they benefited (end user). We agreed Bake Bot was the strongest project to work on, so we moved into gaining greater understandings on it. 
Once the project ideas were heard and fully comprehended we moved on to discussing some features and benefits of the website. </p> 
</P>
<p>
We discussed the features in a bit more in depth to gain a thorough understanding and also agree on what we will be able to manage & what will work for the assignments. <br>
 We agreed to keep Bake Bot as simple as possible In order to make it a user friendly and an achievable target. <br>
 
Once we understood the end product we wanted, we needed to understand what was behind each feature and how to develop that. We are still in the progress of understanding what technology is going into the back end to ensure smooth and cost effective operation. 
</p>
<p>After we gained an understanding of what the project would do, we implemented a check list of what work was required, who was going to do it and when it needed to be done by. <br> 
This was discussed in the meetings and followed up on in the weekly meetings. This was to check up on everyones progress and ensure any challenges where delt with in a timely manner. </pr>

<p>
<p> Previously when we studied each others personality and learning style tests results, it helped ascertain each others skill sets. 
This helped us allocate roles, titles and positions.  This was a discussion and analysation of our personal characters. We tried to align each person in their best role according to their previous personality test and ideal job outcome. We wanted each person in their position of strength. We took the approach here of building a strong company rather putting people where they are weaker and needed strengthening on. 
.</p>
<p>The roles we allocated are </p>
<li>Business Manager - Peter</li>
<li>GUI Designer - Blake</li>
<li>Program Tester - Will</li>
<li>Marketing Manager - Josh</li>
<li>Software Engineering - Martina</li>


<p>
We are currently in discussions about design and layout, we have agreed on version one of Blake's 3 designs. We agree we want Bake Bot to be as simple as possible to use, with a modern comforting home cooking theme. When a user sees our page they instantly can feel the vibe we are going for, warm heart filling home baking vibe where you can almost smell walking into a house with the oven on baking something delicious yet to be discovered. 
.</p>
Basic foundations of our development idea have been set out and white boarded, we have discussed and designed the features and a basic UI, we have discussed and gained understanding in how each feature works and who it will benefit. We have established our target audience, monetization structure and a basic road map. These are only foundations for us to work from and there is a lot more involved in the future to develop this. 
.</p>

<p>Currently we have a thorough understanding of what we want, we are now looking in how the achieve the desired outcome, what technology is needed to deliver our desired outcome.  We have had discussions of building prototype or designing the app on MIT app innovator. Should we have time we will build the app, otherwise we will design a simple prototype.  
</p> <p> We have been keeping a weekly log as to what has been done by each team member which can be found on this link <a href="INNNNNSSSSEEERRTTTTT LIIIINNNKKKK HEREE XXXXX "target="_blank"> Weekly log XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</a> </P>

<H2> Prototype designs</h2>
<h3>Prototype mock up </h3>
<p> These designes were created in paint, as a rough guide to the layout of the mobile application. Blade presented us the three options and we voted as a team on option 1. 
This was the begining of the design flow. This process was great, as it formalised the thought of exactly what each feature does. 
</P>

<h1>Dead-ends </h1>
<p>
We are lucky we are yet to run into a dead end, although we are ever progressing and learing from feedback and realisation of deadlines we haven't hit any road blocks. 
I suspect this is due to in depth discussions and planning.
</p><p> We are yet to establish a recipe database which we will have to acquire which may through a road block at us especially considering budget copy write. <br> 
<br>

We may also run into a time issue with inputting and data management, customising each recipe to fit our calculators and integration with our potential api's.
<br> 

<br> One area we did have more of a speed bump then a dead end, is when we watched week 11 from Anthony's weekly webinar. We saw the PDF of another persons submission. Their submission was a lot different then we were going to submit. <br>After watching this video, we had a meeting and revamped our plans on the pdf. <br> 
We adjusted by creating one shared document that everyone will add their content to. This way its not a huge burden for one person, the only thing that needs to be doing now is the design and style of it. 
</p>
<p> The only actual dead end we have had was a 6th team member who joined very late on A2, although it would have been great to have the extra hands we did not hear from him for a long time so he was removed from the group. This is the only dead end that we have come across as a group as of yet. No dead end in the way development </p>






 <h1> Discussions and change of directions. </h1>
<p>Initially wanted Bake Bot to be a data base of recipe's that users could access. Although we realised this may be limiting ourselves to what recipe the user can access. What if they don't like our version of the recipe? </p> 
<p>After a discussion about the limitations of just having our own recipes we decided to include a custom recipe feature, where the user can still use our calculator with their own recipe.
</p><p> Although it's a lot more time consuming for the user to input their own ingredients, its an option for them in the case they have their own recipe they want to convert. Its also beneficial in way of outsourcing our platform to other companies who publish recipes, Potentially they could use our API to display their recipe on their site with our features like Dynamic Recipe. 
</p>

<h1>Future insight.</h1>

 <h3>Smart Appliance integration </h3>
<p>The future of Bake Bot will include integration with many smart appliances.<br>
Although currently we can for-see the use on mostly mobile devices i believe the future of the tech kitchen will flow into our technology nicely. <br>
We will venture into the world of IOT with Integration of smart appliances, scales, ovens, timers, thermomix, microwave, thermometer, blender, range-hood, fridge, watches,any digital timer or alarm & AI photo/text ingredient extraction.
</p>

<h3>Marketing </h3>
<p>
The future of Bake Bot will also need a strong marketing focus to get into every home bakers life, there needs to be a strong influence on people to go to our app opposed to searching google for their calculations. <br>
Blake Bot needs to be efficient, if its not saving time for you, you wont use it. 
Our plan of monetisation is to generate as much website traffic and clicks on page as possible to promote ads and sponsorships so we will need the volume of people to use our service, spreading the word is crucial. 
</p>
<p>Relation ship management will be a key factor of our future success, although our tool is effective in reducing time and stress in the kitchen we need to get it into peoples hands. <br> 
We will need to build strong relations with the websites and people who promote recipe's or any baking needs on line and at seminars. We need to help people realise we exist and help them find us. </p>
Along with relations, we need our website to be SEO friendly, driving organic traffic to us, through blogs and social media. Improving our organic SEO. 
</P>

<p>
<h3>Research </h3>
<p>Research into API use, implementing and testing. <br> 
This will greatly reduce development cost and time, use of API is a great idea for reducing hours, days or possibly weeks of development. If we can find the correct API for what we need its a win. </P>
<p>
<h3> Features </h3>
<p> 
<li>Once we have proof our systems and business is working a future development would be a rewards system, this will encourage users to stay on our application/website. <br> 
Each time a user creates or uses a recipe they get non dollar value rewards, such as trophies, points and user ranking. <br>

They will have a points system, user rating and trophy rewards once they reach certain milestones. They receive points for every task they complete, such as running the timer on a recipe, creating a new recipe or converting ingredients. <br> 
These simple rewards can have a positive impact on users, and may generate return use or at lease encourage it. </li>
<br> 
<li> Release of our own API. <br>
This will enable other companies to use our fantastic dynamic recipe. Promoting us as a company, generating traffic, either displaying our adds/logos or paying for premium services. Either option will generate more income for the business.   </LI>

</p>

<H1> Development </h1>
<p> The development of the software is as follows in two categories. Website and Mobile Apps. 

<h2>Website </h2>
<p>
Bake Bot will require websites in the form of end user and admin/super admin portal. 
End user design will be for the user features, the pretty user friendly version. <br> 
The admin portal will not need to be pretty as its design is for the back end updates, managing and monitoring of what the end user sees and uses. 
The admin portal would include things like, calculations, ingredients, lists, recipes,end user management, stats, reports, images and graphics & potentially a chat feature to chat with users.  
</p>
<p>
Development of the website will need the following.  <br>
<br>
- Wireframe design<br>
- UI and UX Design templates & mockup<br>
- Domain name acquisition & domain hosting service
- content development<br>
- GitHub - Html and CSS.<br>

<h2>Mobile Hybrid App</h2>
<img src="image/Bake Bot Promo.jpg" alt="Prototype sample "style=";width:80%;">
<p> Many of the above are repeated here for the design, layout and structure and databases of the apps. <br>
Apple and Android will need their own version and creation of the app. <br>
<br>
Each Operating system has their own requirements and costs and assessment process. Apple is stricter then android and more expensive. Each OS will need their own subscriptions to maintain the store preferences. <br>
Design of the app will need to flow and be consistent across different platforms such as tablets, ipads and phones. <br>

- As above there will need to be a front end UI and a back end admin portal merged with the website data, potentially use of firebase. <br>
- Flurry for analytics<br>
- ASO<br>
- Add implementation <br>
- TestFlight for testing<br>
- Version updates <br>


- Backend can be accessed via the above admin portal on the website, for stats and client management.

There are many overlapping items on the apple, android and website development and design. <br>
 Although they may need to be altered according to the size and style of the device/page.  The cloud storage can be shared along with databases, lists forms, content and page.
When producing the designs keep these requirements in mind as each platform may differ.
