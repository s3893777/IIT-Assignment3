<h1>What is Bake Bot</h1>
<div class="main-content-section">

<p>Bake Bot�s main feature, the Dynamic Recipe, will allow users to truly custom and simplify their baking recipes to what they want.</p>
<p> With it, a baker would be able to customise the quantity of a given recipe to what they need. Say you want to make three cakes instead of just one. Bake Bot will do all the math for you so you can focus on baking rather than math.
The Dynamic Recipe also shows the recipe�s ingredients in all measurement types so a baker can pick the one to their liking. Never again will you have to quickly lookup how many grams there are in a tbsps or millilitres in a cup. It will all be right here in the Dynamic Recipe. And if applicable, with the simple press of a button you can convert recipes into vegan alternatives or low-fat options. Scouring the internet for vegan cake recipes will be a thing of the past. With Bake Bot�s Dynamic Recipe, all the information you�ll ever need is in your hand whenever you need it.</p><p>
Bake Bot will have a step-by-step Baking Guide from start to finish. It will give a baker the exact time needed to bake a given dish using a countdown alarm, so you never burn your bread. It will also show the precise temperature needed for either fan-forced or conventional ovens. And when a baker wants that tasty crust or is baking a multi-staged recipe, Bake Bot will show when to change temperatures at right time, every time. And if it�s your first time baking a new recipe? No problem. Bake Bot will give you handy tips and tricks so your first time making a souffle isn�t a learning experience but a delicious one.
Ever wanted to bake a specific recipe but forgot its name and can�t for the life of you find it anywhere? Or maybe you want to try something new that you have never had before? With Bake Bot�s intuitive Recipe Search, you can. Just enter in some key details like if the recipe is it chocolaty, fruity, or savoury? Or maybe what it feels like, is it fluffy, crunchy, or spongy. You can even search for recipes by nationality, like Danish for their pastries, French for their rich complex desserts, or Britain for those simple tea cakes. And if you want to try new things, you can randomly search for recipes to find those surprise favourites. 
Bake Bot doesn�t just help you bake, it teachers you too. Bake Bot�s Baking Beginner's Guide provides users with a structured ten recipe short course to teach the fundamentals of baking for beginners. From simple stuff like baking blueberry muffins and pancakes, to the baking essentials like how to make your own self-rising flour or dough. Informative notes in each recipe will help you every step of the way making sure you�re learning and on track.</p><p> Everyone from kids to adults trying out baking for the first time can benefit from this. Make it an event and learn baking as a family with Bake Bot.
Bake Bot will have a Baking Journal where you can save and keep your favourite custom recipes so that they�re never lost. The Baking Journal also means you don�t have to go through the hassle of picking a specific quantity every time you start the same recipe again. The Baking Journal can also be used to see your history of bakes, showing every recipe you baked and how quickly you did them, so you can see how much you have improved as a baker from start to finish. With Bake Bot, an entire baking book and more is at your fingertips.
</p>

<h1>How It works.</h1>
<p>Bake Bot is a web and mobile based application, that users can access from any online device, there is no subscription needed. </p>
<p> Bake Bot is a free to use tool to help users bake, by utilising our pre determined algorithms to assist their baking. Bake Bot has a serious of pre-determined algorithms and conversions that users can access in a user-friendly manner.  </p>
<h2> End User </h2>
<p>From an end user prospective you will proceed to www.bakebot.com.au (or similar depending on availability.) or install the Bake Bot Mobile App,  Once you are on the website or app. you will be given a few options such as, Recipe search which is our dynamic recipe. This page will have a search function where the user can type what they are looking to bake, once the recipe is selected the user will be able to use this recipe as a dynamic recipe, meaning you can easily adjust the quantities according to the amount of people your baking for. </p> 
<p> The user will also have another option called custom recipe, this page will allow you to enter your measurements from an alternative source. Once you enter your measurements you will be able to quickly convert the measurement to the measurement of preference. In the case the measurements are not what your used to. An example is foreign recipes in alternative measurements then what you may find locally. </p>
<p> In this scenario you are also able to adjust measurements according to your preffered peron or baking volume count. 
<p>The end user will have access to sliding scales and also drop downs.  An example would be converting cups to grams. In this sample scenario a user will enter their cup measurement e.g., � Cup you will be able to slide the cup measurement up or down and instantly see the grams according to where the slider is placed.  In this case � Cup is 40 Grams, giving the user a quick calculation on the spot. You are also able to convert from many different forms of measurements and weights, opening the door to international baking recipes. </p>
<p>
The end user can also adjust the recipe depending on amount of people to cook for. In the case they are happy with the measuring reference and they want to know how many ingredients to use according to their desired output volume not the just the output volume the recipe mentioned. They are able to utelise the sliding scale to adjust the ingredients according to their output volume required. An example. The recipe mentioned making 6 cupcakes, but you have 8 people attending, you will be able to input your 8 people and the dynamic recipe will adjust the ingredients to allow the correct measurements for 8 people. 
. Our target audience are home bakers, our tool is designed to reduce stress and basically hold your hand through the customisation of any baking recipe making the scalability of recipes a no brainer. 
</p>
<p>The users will have the opportunity to save their favourite measuring style, defaulting their settings to show their favourite style of measurements, e.g., grams instead of ounces. Along with favourite volume of people, in the case you often bake for the same group this will speed the process of our system. 
.</p>
<h2> Back End </h2>
<p>Behind the scenes there will be standard algorithms that adjust depending on what the user inserts. For the ingredients there will be pre-determined conversion algorithms such as
(128grams = 1 cup.)  (4.2 cups = 1 ltr.) (1 ltr = .26 gallon.)  (0075Gallon = 1 ounce)
Items listed will be (Metric, US, Imperial) as follows
Cups, DL, OZ, Gal, KG, Ml, Pt, Qt, Lb, Tablespoon, Teaspoon & Celsius/Fahrenheit, 
.</p>
<p>In relation to the per person measurements Bake Bot will calculate the standard recipe divide the ingredients by amount of people in that same recipe and determine the per person ratio. Once that is determined the user will select the correct amount of people they want, and Bake Bot will multiply the per person ingredient ration to the desired person count.
</p>



 <h1>Why Blake Bot?</h1>
<p>A few years ago, I decided to learn how to cook. I wanted to learn every area of cooking, so when it came time to learn baking, I was quite intimidated. It looked hard. It looked complicated. And it was. Measurements were all over the place, with tablespoons and teaspoons and cups and grams. You had to do math for some reason. And the recipes were hard too. One mistake could ruin everything. </p>
<p> It was uniquely difficult from any other type of cooking I had done up to this point. And the worst part was�all of it was unnecessary. You do not have to do math while cooking. You do not have to constantly look up how many tablespoons are in a cup. We have apps for that, right? Except we don�t, all the cooking apps were for making grocery lists or for diet fads.
</p><p> This is when the idea came to me, if no one else was going to do it then I would have to do it myself. And make baking hassle-free forever.
</p>


 <h1>Story & Progress.</h1>
 
Our progress on Bake Bot. In the early progress of the Bake Bot we were first trying to establish connections, build report and to understand each other, in order to know who we are working with and work out how we would get along.
After we got to know each other a little better, it was time to understand everyones project ideas. </p> 
<p> We started with a group discussion about all our project ideas, how they worked and who they benefited (end user). We agreed Bake Bot was the best project to work on, so we moved into gaining greater understandings on it. 
Once the project ideas were heard and fully comprehended we moved on to discussing some features and benefits of the website. </p> 
<p>
We discussed the features in a bit more in depth to gain a thorough understanding and also agree on what we will be able to manage & what will work for the assignments. We agreed to keep Bake Bot as simple as possible In order to make it a user friendly and an achievable target. 
Once we understood the end product we wanted, we needed to understand what was behind each feature and how to develop that. We are still in the progress of understanding what technology is going into the back end to ensure smooth and cost effective operation. 
</p>
<p> Previously we studied each others personality and learning stlye tests results in order to help accertain each others skill sets. 
This helped us allocate roles, titles and positions.  This was a discussion and analysation of our personal characters. We tried to align each person in their best role according to their previous personality test and ideal job outcome. We wanted each person in their position of strength. We took the approach here of building a strong company rather putting people where they are weaker and needed strengthening on. 
.</p>
We are currently in discussions about design and layout, we have agreed one version one of Blakes 3 designs. We agree we want Bake Bot to be as simple as possible to use, with a modern comforting home cooking theme. When a user sees our page they instantly can feel the vibe we are going for, warm heart filling home baking vibe where you can almost smell walking into a house with the oven on baking something delicious yet to be discovered. 
.</p>
Basic foundations of our development idea have been set out and white boarded, we have discussed and designed the features and a basic UI, we have discussed and gained understanding in how each feature works and who it will benefit. We have established our target audience, monetization structure and a basic road map. These are only foundations for us to work from and there is a lot more involved in the future to develop this. 
.</p>

<p>Currently we have a thorough understanding of what we want, we are now looking in how the achieve the desired outcome, what technology is needed to deliver our desired outcome.  We have had discussions of building prototype or designing the app on MIT app innovator. Should we have time we will build the app, otherwise we will design a simple prototype.  
</p>


<h1>Dead-ends </h1>
<p>
We are lucky we are yet to run into a dead end, although we are ever progressing and learing from feedback and realisation of deadlines we haven�t hit any road blocks. 
I suspect this is due to in depth discussions and planning.
</p><p> We are yet to establish a recipe database which we will have to acquire which may through a road block at us especially considering budget copy write. We may also run into a time issue with inputting and data management, customising each recipe to fit our calculators and integration with our potential api�s.
</p>
<p> The only dead end we have had was a 6th team member who joined very late on A2, although it would have been great to have the extra hands we did not hear from him for a long time so he was removed from the group. This is the only dead end that we have come across as a group as of yet. No dead end in the way development </p>






 <h1> Discussions and change of directions. </h1>
<p>Initially wanted Bake Bot to be a data base of recipe�s that users could access. Although we realised this may be limiting ourselves to what recipe the user can access. What if they don�t like our version of the recipe? </p> 
<p>After a discussion about the limitations of just having our own recipes we decided to include a custom recipe feature, where the user can still use our calculator with their own recipe.
</p><p> Although it�s a lot more time consuming for the user to input their own ingredients, its an option for them in the case they have their own recipe they want to convert. Its also benificial in way of outsourcing our platform to other companies who publish recipes, Potentially they could use our API to display their recipe on their site with our fetures like Dynamic Recipe.

<h1>Future insight.</h1>
<p>
The future of Bake Bot will include many smart appliances. Although currently we can forsee the use on mostly mobile devices i beleive the future of the tech kitchen will flow into our technology nicely.
We will venture into the world of IOT with Integration of smart appliances, scales, ovens, timers, thermomix, microwave, thermometer, blender, rangehood, fridge, watches,any digital timer or alarm & AI photo/text ingredient extraction.
</p><p>
As of today the future of Bake Bot will need a strong marketing focus to get into every home bakers life, there needs to be a strong influence on people to go to our app opposed to searching google for their calculations, Blake Bot needs to be efficient, if its not saving time for you, you wont use it. 
Our basic plan of monetisation is to generate as much website traffic and clicks on page as possible to promote ads and sponsorships. 
</p><p>
<p>Relation ship management will be a key factor of our future success, although our tool is effective in reducing time and stress in the kitchen we need to get it into peoples hands. We will need to build strong relations with the websites and people who promote receipes or any baking needs online and at seminars. We need to help people realise we exist and help them find us. </p>
Along with relations, we need our website to be SEO friendly, driving organic traffic to us, through blogs and social media. Improving our organic SEO.
