    <h1>Group Process</h1>

    <div class="main-content section">

      <p>In assignment two, our group greatly suffered from poor or lack of communication, with some members not being
        able to make it to the regular Wednesday meetings as the time didnâ€™t match up with work or other life commitments.
        Though we started assignment three on a bad foot, being two weeks behind. We made a deliberate effort to increase
        team communication and coordination. First, we got everyone to state what day they are available and when to
        arrange a better, more regular team meeting date. Second, we all decided as a group to greatly increase regular
        communication on MS Teams, update each other daily with progress, tasks completed, and problems faced. As a team,
        going into assignment three, we sort to improve upon where we most lacked in teamwork, to rise above the problems
        we faced as a group, and to not just finish assignment three better than assignment two, but to also create a
        greater team dynamic.
      </P>
