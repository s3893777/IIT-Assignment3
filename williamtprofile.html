            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            <p><strong>Student ID: </strong>s3905591
                <br><strong>Email: </strong>s3905591@student.rmit.edu.au
            </p>
            <p>Born and raised in Australia, I also have Vietnamese heritage. I enjoy creating plastic models of robots
              (scaled down) in my free time. I find enjoyment in this hobby; due to the fact as a child, I found robots
              to be cool and amazing in a way that I can't really explain; that’s partly where my interest began from.</p>

            <p>My interest in IT grew from a young age as my family owned a PC. I'm still amazed by how IT has evolved
              over the past years, and I'm intrigued to see how it will keep growing. The only IT experience I have was
              when I was studying in high school, where I had two classes on IT, one class was about software, and the
              other was networking.</p>

            <h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
            <h3>William’s Ideal Job is a Network and Systems Administrator</h3>
                <p>In this position, critical and creative thinking is a must. William would determine an organisation’s system needs, 
                  gather data, and install network hardware and software. He would also upgrade, maintain and repair networks, ensure that
                  systems are operating correctly, maintain network and computer system security, and evaluate and optimize networks.
                  He would monitor system performance and efficiencies, add users to a network, assign and update security permissions
                  on the network, and train users in the correct use of systems. He would solve any errors or issues once alerted to the problem.</p>
