      <p>During this assignment, we were able to complete most of the tasks assigned to us. These tasks include creating a prototype application,
        producing a pitch and setting the basics of a business plan for Bake Bot. For many of us, we did well with learning new skills, for example,
        learning how to use “protype.io”, GitHub, and writing code for a website. Building on assignment 2, the communication side has increased a
        couple of days before the assignment is due.</p>

      <p>From the beginning of this assignment and the previous assignment, communication has been one of our weaknesses. Unfortunately, we have not improved.
        Only in the last couple of days communication has improved significantly. We also need to find a better way to collaborate with this assignment. Maybe
        to find a better time for us to meet or to have another communication too such as “WhatsApp” or “google classrooms”. As a team, we needed to have a better
        understanding of the task’s requirement for the assignment. This includes asking questions to classify sections of the assignment.</p>

      <p>Everyone manages to complete all task before the check deadline. Another surprising factor was how communication improve once the deadline grew closer.</p>

      <p>As a group, many issues will arise when working in a team. One key issue that we need to focus on is to have a better way of communication. If communication
        breaks, the task will not be complete on time. We also need to better understand the team’s strength and weakness.</p>

      <p>The GitHub log is not a great representative of the group work As some of us are still unable to work out how GitHub works. GitHub is a great tool for online
        collaboration work for creating a webpage. We are also seeing if two people are working on the same page. GitHub was unable to merge the same page from different
        users. When a team member has edited a page and another member has already pushed their changes on the same page. Sometimes data will be deleted.</p>

      <h2>Peter Kassis</h2>

      <p>We all work really well on our own. I feel the team are all responsible and take pride in their work. Everyone
        jumped on their work and got it done.
      </P>
      <p>
        I feel we all could give each other more feedback or check each other's work more, or even allocate one person
        to check over everyone's work to ensure no tasks are missed.
        Communication, I feel that communication could be improved on, maybe we needed two meetings per week. As we
        started late, the time is short. <Br> I think we should of uploaded our work as we did it to github. This gives
        everyone an idea where everyone is up to without the need to ask people.
      </P>
      <p>
        For future group work, I will initiate a discussion about everyone's work, each person needs to tell us what
        their work involves, and we need to assess as a group if they have it under control or where they need to
        adjust. One at the start and one at the end, where they run over their work, and we can confirm it ticks the
        boxes.
        <br>
        I i will also recommend everyone uploads to github from start to finish.
      </P>
      <p>
        I was surprised my issue was the same this time as it was last time. The communication issue reappeared and
        feedback.
      </P>
      Communication is so crucial; we need to be on top of our work and each other's. As a team, we need to each have
      our work and our commitment to the team as a priority. It’s a little challenging to have a thorough understanding
      of the entire project, ensure everyone has a thorough understanding of their tasks and then progress.
      </P>

      <p>My github contributions are well documented in GitHub. As I adjusted along the way and used GitHub as my shared
        platform as well as Microsoft teams. I don’t think it shows the other team members history accurately, as
        everyone uploaded towards the end.If you're checking only GitHubs log, you will not get a good reflection of the
        other team members commitment.
      </P>


      <h2> Joshua Crilley </h3>
        <p> Although we started this assignment late, I feel the team is a great team who did their tasks well. I am
          disappointed
          I could not contribute to the assignment as much as I wanted to due to life circumstances. Although, I am
          pleased to be a
          part of the A Team. Working in a group is more challenging as I feel more pressure to not let the team down.
          Although I like
          working with people there are more factors involved with the demands of a team. </P>



        <h2>William Truong</h2>

        <p>We may have started the assignment 3 project later than most people but as soon as we all knew what had to be
          done, we all started to do our individual tasks as quickly as possible. It's a little surprising that we may
          finish this assignment quicker than I had thought, ignoring the fact that it's due very soon. The
          communication
          between the team members was pretty good, using Microsoft Teams to post inquiries or suggestions was helpful
          for
          me for this project. Group meetings were done mostly weekly, and I think that weekly is good enough anymore
          will
          be a bit excessive as we all are busy people. Not everyone will show up to the meetings, but team members
          would
          later eventually watch the recordings to understand what has happened, but it
          would be better if everyone had a meeting in the present. One thing that I have learnt working as a group is
          that I'm not usually someone who works well with a group, but this group surprisingly wasn't so bad to work
          with
          as they had my back on stuff that I'm weak at. </p>

        <h2>Blade Sabre</h2>
        <p>We started assignment 3 fairly late. Missing out on the first two crucial weeks for the project. Everyone,
          including myself, was busy with weekly course tasks as well as work. Still, I feel that better communication
          could have gotten the team back together sooner and I wouldn’t have had to intervene as the new team leader. I
          don’t regret becoming the de facto leader as I have learned many things I wouldn’t have otherwise. But one
          thing
          that I did learn that surprised me was that I am not a good team leader. I am just not built for it. I feel
          that
          I have let the team down with bad leadership and poor direction. Someone like Martina or Peter was probably a
          better fit for the job; I just happened to fill it instead. I have definitely learned that it is the team
          leader’s job to get people moving and that indecisive leadership wastes time and good effort from other
          teammates. I think our team did well with the limited time we had to get this project done and, individually,
          members like Peter and William went above and beyond to get the work done fast. However, as a group, we
          suffered
          from poor communication, time management, and bad leadership.</p>

        <h2>Martina Huynh</h2>
        <p>Assignment 3 was slow to start. Once we sorted out what had to be done, we were back on track. As per the
          last assignment,
          we are still struggling with communication. Unfortunately, I was even later to start the assignment. Luckily,
          the rest of the
          group we able to set all the tasks. </p>

        <p>Once the deadline came closer our communication got better. Using MS Teams messager/chat to our group. Asking
          if they have made any
          progress with their section. I think instead of a weekly check-up, we needed to check in with each other more
          regularly. MS Teams has
          made it easier to communicate, but it is difficult to communicate thoughts and feeling via a chat.
