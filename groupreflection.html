      <h2>Peter Kassis</h2>
      <h3>What went well </h3>
      <p>We all work really well on our own. I feel the team are all responsible and take pride in their work. Everyone
        jumped on their work and got it done.
      </P>
      <h3> What could be improved </h3>
      <p>
        I feel we all could give each other more feedback or check each other's work more, or even allocate one person
        to check over everyone's work to ensure no tasks are missed.
        Communication, I feel that communication could be improved on, maybe we needed two meetings per week. As we
        started late, the time is short. <Br> I think we should of uploaded our work as we did it to github. This gives
        everyone an idea where everyone is up to without the need to ask people.
      </P>

      <h3>Future Group work </H3>
      <p>
        For future group work, I will initiate a discussion about everyone's work, each person needs to tell us what
        their work involves, and we need to assess as a group if they have it under control or where they need to
        adjust. One at the start and one at the end, where they run over their work, and we can confirm it ticks the
        boxes.
        <br>
        I i will also recommend everyone uploads to github from start to finish.
      </P>
      <h3>At least one thing that was surprising</h3>
      <p>
        I was surprised my issue was the same this time as it was last time. The communication issue reappeared and
        feedback.
      </P>
      <p>
      <h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h3>
      Communication is so crucial; we need to be on top of our work and each other's. As a team, we need to each have
      our work and our commitment to the team as a priority. It’s a little challenging to have a thorough understanding
      of the entire project, ensure everyone has a thorough understanding of their tasks and then progress.
      </P>

      <h3>GitHub reflects </h3>
      <p>My contributions are well documented in GitHub. As I adjusted along the way and used GitHub as my shared
        platform as well as Microsoft teams. I don’t think it shows the other team members history accurately, as
        everyone uploaded towards the end.If you're checking only GitHubs log, you will not get a good reflection of the
        other team members commitment.
      </P>

      <h2>William Truong</h2>

      <p>We may have started the assignment 3 project later than most people but as soon as we all knew what had to be
        done, we all started to do our individual tasks as quickly as possible. It's a little surprising that we may
        finish this assignment quicker than I had thought, ignoring the fact that it's due very soon. The communication
        between the team members was pretty good, using Microsoft Teams to post inquiries or suggestions was helpful for
        me for this project. Group meetings were done mostly weekly, and I think that weekly is good enough anymore will
        be a bit excessive as we all are busy people. Not everyone will show up to the meetings, but team members would
        later eventually watch the recordings to understand what has happened, but it
        would be better if everyone had a meeting in the present. One thing that I have learnt working as a group is
        that I'm not usually someone who works well with a group, but this group surprisingly wasn't so bad to work with
        as they had my back on stuff that I'm weak at. </p>

      <h2>Blade Sabre</h2>
      <p>We started assignment 3 fairly late. Missing out on the first two crucial weeks for the project. Everyone,
        including myself, was busy with weekly course tasks as well as work. Still, I feel that better communication
        could have gotten the team back together sooner and I wouldn’t have had to intervene as the new team leader. I
        don’t regret becoming the de facto leader as I have learned many things I wouldn’t have otherwise. But one thing
        that I did learn that surprised me was that I am not a good team leader. I am just not built for it. I feel that
        I have let the team down with bad leadership and poor direction. Someone like Martina or Peter was probably a
        better fit for the job; I just happened to fill it instead. I have definitely learned that it is the team
        leader’s job to get people moving and that indecisive leadership wastes time and good effort from other
        teammates. I think our team did well with the limited time we had to get this project done and, individually,
        members like Peter and William went above and beyond to get the work done fast. However, as a group, we suffered
        from poor communication, time management, and bad leadership.</p>

      <h2>Martina Huynh</h2>
      <p>Assignment 3 was start slow. Once we sort out what had to be done we were back on track. As per last assigment
        we are still struggling with communciation. Unfortunately I was even later to start the assignment. Luckly the
        rest of the group we able to set all the tasks. </p>

    <p>Once the deadline came closer our communication got better. Using MS Teams messager/chat to out people. Asking if they have made any progress with their section. I think instead of weekly check up we need to check in with each other more regularly. MS Teams has made is easier for commmunication but is it difficult of communicate thoughts and feeling via a chat.</p>
