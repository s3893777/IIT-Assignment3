	<p>- What went well 
We all work really well on our own. I feel the team are all responsible and take pride in their work. Everyone jumped on their work and got it done. 
  
- What could be improved –  
I feel we all could give each other more feedback or check each other's work more, or even allocate one person to check over everyone's work to ensure no tasks are missed.  
Communication, I feel that communication could be improved on, maybe we needed two meetings per week. As we started late, the time is short. 
  
I think for future group work, I will initiate a discussion about everyone's work, each person needs to tell us what their work involves, and we need to assess as a group if they have it under control or where they need to adjust. One at the start and one at the end, where they run over their work, and we can confirm it ticks the boxes.  
At least one thing that was surprising – 
I was surprised my issue was the same this time as it was last time. The communication issue reappeared and feedback.  
  
At least one thing that you have learned about groups –  
Communication is so crucial; we need to be on top of our work and each other's. As a team, we need to each have our work and our commitment to the team as a priority. It’s a little challenging to have a thorough understanding of the entire project, ensure everyone has a thorough understanding of their tasks and then progress.  
  
GitHub reflects my contributions well, as I adjusted along the way and used GitHub as my shared platform as well as Microsoft teams. I don’t think it shares the others well as everyone uploaded towards the end, and if you're checking only GitHub, you will not get a good reflection of the team's commitment.
