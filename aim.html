    <h1>Aim</h1>
    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>Goal 1 â€“ Perform the sums so you would not need too!</h2>
      <p>User will have the ability to either input recipes themselves or have Bake Bot to search the web for recipes. User will need to input how many serves they would like to make. As user has input the number of serving. Bake Bot will be able to convert the measurements from the original recipe to match the number of serving needed. Bake Bot would then create a step-by-step recipe guide on how to cook the chosen recipe. Bake Bot will also use the original recipe that user has chosen and create the necessary timers for the recipe. This is the backbone of the app. </p>

      <p>Bake Bot will also have the availability to favourite and creating a recipe journal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>Goal 2 - Purchasing Baking Courses</h2>
      <p>To help monetise the app we will be creating baking/cooking courses the user can purchase. To "wet the user's whistle" Bake Bot will provide a handful of baking basics to provided free.  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>Goal 3 - Purchase Products</h2>
      <p>Another way Bake Bot will be able to monetise the app is the ability to purchase products.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>Goal 5 - Meal Planner</h2>
      <p>As user has created a journal of recipes. They will then be able to create a meal plan with the saved recipes
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>Goal 6 - groceries list</h2>
      <p>As a meal plan has been created a groceries list can be created. Having a groceries list is important as it
        help the user to stay on track and not be distracted by other items in the store. Resulting in money saved. </p>
      <p>The products that are required will match the product at the store. This will also reduce food wastage.</p>
