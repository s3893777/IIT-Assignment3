  <div class="main-content">
    <h1>Aim</h1>
    <p>To create a proof-of-concept for the Bake Bot app through proto.io wireframes. As to show and demonstrate the UI and features of A future Bake Bot app.</p>

    <p>Only Goal one is necessary to achieve the aim of this project, however, the secondary goals improve upon this aim. </p>
    <div class="main-content-section">

      </div>

    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>Goal 1 â€“ Perform the sums so you would not need too!</h2>
      <p>The user will have the ability to either input recipes themselves or have Bake Bot search its recipe index for recipes. The user will need to input how many servings they would like to make. When the user has inputted the number of servings. Bake Bot will be able to convert the measurements from the original recipe to match the number of serving needed. Bake Bot would then create a step-by-step recipe guide on how to cook the chosen recipe. Bake Bot will also use the original recipe that the user has chosen and create the necessary timers for the recipe. This is the backbone of the app. </p>

         <p>Bake Bot will also have the availability to favourite and creating a recipe journal.</p>

 </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>Goal 2 - Purchasing Baking Courses</h2>
      <p>To help monetise the app we will be creating baking/cooking courses the user can purchase. To "wet the user's whistle" Bake Bot will provide a handful of baking basics to provided free. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>Goal 3 - Purchase Products</h2>
      <p>Another way Bake Bot will be able to monetise the app is the ability to purchase products. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>Goal 4 - Meal Planner</h2>
      <p>When a user has created a journal of recipes, they will then be able to create meal plans with the saved recipes. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content-section">
      <h2>Goal 5 - groceries list</h2>
      <p>When a meal plan has been created, a groceries list can be created from it. Having a groceries list is important as it helps the user to stay on track and not be distracted by other items in the store. Resulting in money saved. </p>

      <p>The products that are required will match the product at the store. This will also reduce food wastage.  </p>
